# A front-end coding challenge from @frontendmentor! 🎉 

I had to complete this project using TailwindCSS within a tight 12-hour deadline. Despite having no prior experience with TailwindCSS, I gave it my best shot and used it extensively throughout the project. Due to time constraints 😒, I had to resort to using simple CSS for specific tasks such as colors and responsiveness.

I'm proud of myself for taking on the challenge 💪 and learning TailwindCSS from scratch within a short span of time 💀. I was able to complete 👌 the project and deliver a functional product, which was a great accomplishment.

Next time, I would dedicate more time to learning and mastering TailwindCSS or CSS, rather than trying to rush 🏃💨 through a project. I would use either CSS or TailwindCSS exclusively to deepen my expertise in one tool and deliver a more polished product. This experience taught me the importance of time management and the value of focused learning 🤓

Any suggestions on how I can improve are welcome! 😇
